# MarvelStudiosDB
For the purposes of the course _Databases_ (9th semester), as a team, we had to develop a **relational database**. Data demands, user categories and privilages are reported. Based on the **Chen's notation**, we construct the E/R Diagram of the database and consequently its Relational Model, including the required constraints. Lastly, we define some typical views and queries in order to accent the functionality of our database. Both of them are written in SQL language. 

For the database implementation we use MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE and MariaDB 5.5 server.

Me and my team, as Marvel enthusiasts, decided to develop a database that meets the **Marvel Cinematic Universe's** needs.
