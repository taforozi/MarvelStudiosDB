# MarvelStudiosDB
For the purposes of the course _Databases_ (9th semester), as a team, we had to develop a **relational database**. Data demands, user categories and privilages are reported. Based on the **Chen's notation**, we construct the E/R Diagram of the database and consequently its Relational Model, including the required constraints. Lastly, we define some typical views and queries (in both relational algebra and SQL language) in order to accent the functionality of our database. 

For the database implementation we use MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE and MariaDB 5.5 server.

Me and my team, as Marvel enthusiasts, decided to develop a database that meets the **Marvel Cinematic Universe's** needs.

## Queries 
The examples that we have implemented can be found in the [Queries](Queries) folder with a description about what each of them serves.

## Views
The examples that we have implemented can be found in the [Views](Views) folder with a description about what each of them serves.

## MarvelStudiosDB.mwb
This file constitutes the database model in MySQL Workbench format, while it also exists as a png file extracted from MySQL Workbench.

## MarvelStudiosDB.sql
SQL script that contains the dump for creating the database (tables, constraints, inserted data, views).

## users.sql
SQL script for creating the users of the database and their rights.
